A missing option, a wrong path or port. Webpack is very strict about configuration, and the best way to find out what's wrong is to compare your project to an already working setup, such as **[React Hot Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate)**, bit by bit. We're also gathering **[Troubleshooting Recipes](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/Troubleshooting.md)** so send a PR if you have a lesson to share!\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocs are in a bit of a flux right now because I'm in the process of updating everything to document the major 1.0 release.\n\nIf you just learned about React Hot Loader and want to find out more, **[check out the walkthrough](http://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/getstarted/)** and then try one of the **[starter kits](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/tree/master/docs#starter-kits)**.\n\nIf you've been with us for a while, read **[1.0 release notes and migration guide](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/blob/master/docs/README.md#migrating-to-10)**.\n\n## Got Questions?\n\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/gaearon/react-hot-loader?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n## Coming Soon\n\n* Hot Reloading [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router) routes\n* Hot Reloading [Flux Stores](https://github.com/gaearon/flux-hot-loader)\n\nWatch the repo to stay tuned!\n\n## License\n\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\n",
