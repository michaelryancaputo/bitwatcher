View the [docs](http://visionmedia.github.com/superagent/).\\n\\n![super agent](http://f.cl.ly/items/3d282n3A0h0Z0K2w0q2a/Screenshot.png)\\n\\n## Installation\\n\\n  node:\\n\\n```\\n$ npm install superagent\\n```\\n\\n  component:\\n\\n```\\n$ component install visionmedia/superagent\\n```\\n\\n  with script tags use ./superagent.js\\n\\n## Motivation\\n\\n  This library spawned from my frustration with jQuery's weak & inconsistent Ajax support. jQuery's API, while having recently added some promise-like support, is largely static, forcing you to build up big objects containing all the header fields and options, not to mention most of the options are awkwardly named \\\"type\\\" instead of \\\"method\\\", etc. Onto examples!\\n\\n  The following is what you might typically do for a simple __GET__ with jQuery:\\n\\n```js\\n$.get('/user/1', function(data, textStatus, xhr){\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\nGreat, it's ok, but it's kinda lame having 3 arguments just to access something on the `xhr`. Our equivalent would be:\\n\\n```js\\nrequest.get('/user/1', function(res){\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThe response object is an instanceof `request.Response`, encapsulating all of this information instead of throwing a bunch of arguments at you. For example, we can check `res.status`, `res.header` for header fields, `res.text`, `res.body` etc.\\n\\nAn example of a JSON POST with jQuery typically might use `$.post()`, however once you need to start defining header fields you have to then re-write it using `$.ajax()`... so that might look like:\\n\\n```js\\n$.ajax({\\n  url: '/api/pet',\\n  type: 'POST',\\n  data: { name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' },\\n  headers: { 'X-API-Key': 'foobar' }\\n}).success(function(res){\\n\\n}).error(function(){\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\n Not only is it ugly, but it's pretty opinionated. jQuery likes to special-case {4,5}xx- for example, you cannot (easily at least) receive a parsed JSON response for say \\\"400 Bad Request\\\". This same request would look like this:\\n\\n```js\\nrequest\\n  .post('/api/pet')\\n  .send({ name: 'Manny', species: 'cat' })\\n  .set('X-API-Key', 'foobar')\\n  .set('Accept', 'application/json')\\n  .end(function(error, res){\\n\\n  });\\n```\\n\\nBuilding on the existing API internally, we also provide something similar to `$.post()` for those times in life where your interactions are very basic:\\n\\n```js\\nrequest.post('/api/pet', cat, function(error, res){\\n\\n});\\n```\\n\\n# Plugins\\n\\nUsage:\\n\\n```js\\nvar nocache = require('no-cache');\\nvar request = require('superagent');\\nvar prefix = require('superagent-prefix')('/static');\\n\\nprefix(request); // Prefixes *all* requests\\n\\nrequest\\n.get('/some-url')\\n.use(nocache) // Prevents caching of *only* this request\\n.end(function(res){\\n    // Do something\\n});\\n```\\n\\nExisting plugins:\\n * [superagent-no-cache](https://github.com/johntron/superagent-no-cache) - prevents caching by including Cache-Control header\\n * [superagent-prefix](https://github.com/johntron/superagent-prefix) - prefixes absolute URLs (useful in test environment)\\n\\nPlease prefix your plugin component with `superagent-*`\\n\\nFor superagent extensions such as couchdb and oauth visit the [wiki](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/wiki).\\n\\n## Running node tests\\n\\n  Install dependencies:\\n\\n     $ npm install\\n\\n  Run em!\\n\\n    $ make test\\n\\n## Running browser tests\\n\\n Install the test server deps (nodejs / express):\\n\\n    $ npm install\\n\\n Start the test server:\\n\\n    $ make test-server\\n\\n Visit `localhost:4000/` in the browser.\\n\\n## Browser build\\n\\n  The browser build of superagent is located in ./superagent.js\\n\\n## Examples:\\n\\n- [agency tests](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/blob/master/test/node/agency.js)\\n- [express demo app](https://github.com/hunterloftis/component-test/blob/master/lib/users/test/controller.test.js)\\n\\n\\n## License\\n\\n  MIT\\n\",\n\t\"readmeFilename\": \"Readme.md\",\n\t\"bugs\": {\n\t\t\"url\": \"https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent/issues\"\n\t},\n\t\"homepage\": \"https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent\",\n\t\"_id\": \"superagent@0.21.0\",\n\t\"_shasum\": \"fb15027984751ee7152200e6cd21cd6e19a5de87\",\n\t\"_resolved\": \"https://registry.npmjs.org/superagent/-/superagent-0.21.0.tgz\",\n\t\"_from\": \"https://registry.npmjs.org/superagent/-/superagent-0.21.0.tgz\"\n}\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/superagent/package.json\n ** module id = 494\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\nexports['application/x-www-form-urlencoded'] = require('./urlencoded');\nexports['application/json'] = require('./json');\nexports.text = require('./text');\nexports.image = require('./image');\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/superagent/lib/node/parsers/index.js\n ** module id = 495\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","\nvar http = require('http');\n\nif (http.METHODS) {\n\n  module.exports = http.METHODS.map(function(method){\n    return method.toLowerCase();\n  });\n\n} else {\n\n  module.exports = [\n    'get',\n    'post',\n    'put',\n    'head',\n    'delete',\n    'options',\n    'trace',\n    'copy',\n    'lock',\n    'mkcol',\n    'move',\n    'purge',\n    'propfind',\n    'proppatch',\n    'unlock',\n    'report',\n    'mkactivity',\n    'checkout',\n    'merge',\n    'm-search',\n    'notify',\n    'subscribe',\n    'unsubscribe',\n    'patch',\n    'search'\n  ];\n\n}\n\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/superagent/~/methods/index.js\n ** module id = 496\n ** module chunks = 0\n **/","var hasOwn = Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;\nvar toString = Object.prototype.toString;\n\nfunction isPlainObject(obj) {\n\tif (!obj || toString.call(obj) !== '[object Object]' || obj.nodeType || obj.setInterval)\n\t\treturn false;\n\n\tvar has_own_constructor = hasOwn.call(obj, 'constructor');\n\tvar has_is_property_of_method = hasOwn.call(obj.constructor.prototype, 'isPrototypeOf');\n\t// Not own constructor property must be Object\n\tif (obj.constructor && !has_own_constructor && !has_is_property_of_method)\n\t\treturn false;\n\n\t// Own properties are enumerated firstly, so to speed up,\n\t// if last one is own, then all properties are own.\n\tvar key;\n\tfor ( key in obj ) {}\n\n\treturn key === undefined || hasOwn.call( obj, key );\n};\n\nmodule.exports = function extend() {\n\tvar options, name, src, copy, copyIsArray, clone,\n\t    target = arguments[0] || {},\n\t    i = 1,\n\t    length = arguments.length,\n\t    deep = false;\n\n\t// Handle a deep copy situation\n\tif ( typeof target === \"boolean\" ) {\n\t\tdeep = target;\n\t\ttarget = arguments[1] || {};\n\t\t// skip the boolean and the target\n\t\ti = 2;\n\t}\n\n\t// Handle case when target is a string or something (possible in deep copy)\n\tif ( typeof target !== \"object\" && typeof target !== \"function\") {\n\t\ttarget = {};\n\t}\n\n\tfor ( ;

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.
